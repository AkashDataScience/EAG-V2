# PDF.js Setup Instructions

## Current Status
The extension now has PDF support implemented, but you need to add the actual PDF.js library for full functionality.

## To Enable Full PDF Support:

### Option 1: Download PDF.js (Recommended)
1. Go to https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/
2. Download the latest stable release
3. Extract the files
4. Copy `pdf.min.js` and `pdf.worker.min.js` to your extension folder
5. Replace the current `pdf.min.js` with the real one

### Option 2: Use CDN (Development Only)
1. Download the PDF.js files from the CDN
2. Save them locally in your extension folder
3. Update the script references

### Option 3: Use the Mock Version (Current)
The current implementation includes a mock PDF.js that will show instructions instead of extracting text. This is useful for testing the UI without the full library.

## Files Needed:
- `pdf.min.js` - Main PDF.js library
- `pdf.worker.min.js` - Web worker for PDF processing

## Current Implementation:
The extension is ready for PDF support and will:
1. ✅ Accept PDF file uploads
2. ✅ Attempt to extract text using PDF.js
3. ✅ Show helpful fallback messages if extraction fails
4. ✅ Provide alternative methods for PDF processing

## Testing:
1. Upload a PDF file
2. The extension will attempt to extract text
3. If successful, the text will appear in the text area
4. If it fails, you'll get helpful instructions

## Next Steps:
1. Add the real PDF.js library files
2. Test with various PDF types
3. Optimize for large PDF files
4. Add progress indicators for long extractions
