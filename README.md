# Course: Extensive AI Agents Program (EAG V2)

**Duration:** 20 Sessions (Semester-style program)  
**Institution:** [The School of AI](https://theschoolof.ai/)  
**Course Type:** AI Agents & Multi-Agent Systems

## About EAG V2

EAG V2 (Extensive AI Agents Program) is a comprehensive 20-session course that equips students to build advanced Agentic AI systems, capable of autonomous decision-making, task orchestration, and seamless interaction within complex web environments. Unlike traditional AI programs, this curriculum focuses on designing browser-based agents that leverage the latest advancements in LLMs, retrieval-augmented systems, and multi-agent collaboration.

### Key Features

- **Revolutionary Approach**: Design agents that mirror human-like intelligence
- **Browser-Based Agents**: Build autonomous systems for web environments
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Learn advanced multi-agent frameworks
- **No Traditional Tools**: This course does NOT teach langChain, langGraph, crew.ai, or n8n
- **Build from Scratch**: Create your own advanced multi-model Agentic Frameworks
