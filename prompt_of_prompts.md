1. ✅ Explicit Reasoning Instructions  
   - Does the prompt tell the model to reason step-by-step?  
   - Does it include instructions like “explain your thinking” or “think before you answer”?

2. ✅ Structured Output Format  
   - Does the prompt enforce a predictable output format (e.g., FUNCTION_CALL, JSON, numbered steps)?  
   - Is the output easy to parse or validate?

3. ✅ Separation of Reasoning and Tools  
   - Are reasoning steps clearly separated from computation or tool-use steps?  
   - Is it clear when to calculate, when to verify, when to reason?

4. ✅ Conversation Loop Support  
   - Could this prompt work in a back-and-forth (multi-turn) setting?  
   - Is there a way to update the context with results from previous steps?

5. ✅ Instructional Framing  
   - Are there examples of desired behavior or “formats” to follow?  
   - Does the prompt define exactly how responses should look?

6. ✅ Internal Self-Checks  
   - Does the prompt instruct the model to self-verify or sanity-check intermediate steps?

7. ✅ Reasoning Type Awareness  
   - Does the prompt encourage the model to tag or identify the type of reasoning used (e.g., arithmetic, logic, lookup)?

8. ✅ Error Handling or Fallbacks  
   - Does the prompt specify what to do if an answer is uncertain, a tool fails, or the model is unsure?

9. ✅ Overall Clarity and Robustness  
   - Is the prompt easy to follow?  
   - Is it likely to reduce hallucination and drift?
